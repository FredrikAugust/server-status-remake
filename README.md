# Remake of @Tijndagamer's "_Server Status_" page.

As the last version I made was insecure, dysfunctional, badly optimized and in general quite bad I decided to remake the entire project, this time featuring semi-good code.

The project is built using **angular (js)** for front-end, **express (js)** for back-end and **plotly (js)** for the graphs. I might add more stuff later, but this is all for now. Please notify me if I forgot to add something here.
